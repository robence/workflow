### Issue tracking
Keeping track of the progress of an application development results in dependable, more effective execution. 
This starts with a standardized planning process. Being familiar with it helps us get to know the big picture, the overall plan. 
To make the deadlines one must learn what it takes to finish stories, epics and milestones and how best to accomplish it.

### Planning

#### User Stories
Requirements are decomposed into small feature sets and made into user stories.
A user story is short description of a small feature, in as simple and concise format as possible.
User stories are independent, autonomous features, small pieces of the whole.
User stories are prioritized, the most important ones are the next to-do items.

#### Tasks
In order to implement a user story a more technical approach is required. 
Detailed information about the technologies used, the requirements and wanted result described from a more implementation-near angle.
A user story tells what should happen, a task guides us through the how.

#### Issues
While a task helps a developer, it is often just a tiny piece, one of the many. A developer can be easily overwhelmed by the number of tasks, 
the number of things one has to deliver. To get a clear view how each task connects to the others a hierarchy os desired. 
Tasks are organized into issues containing only a handful of items. 
Reducing complexity helps maintaining clear vision and keeping track of remaining objectives.

### Pipelines
Visualization is key to have a clear view of current progress and status of issues. A kanban board is a simple and effective solution. 
This board can be on your computer or in your office as well. It contains columns as a spreadsheet does, pipes if you'd like. 
Every column represents a stage of the issues lifecycle. These mostly consist of Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Verify and Done.
