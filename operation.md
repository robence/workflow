### Issue tracking
Keeping track of the progress of an application development results in dependable, more effective execution. 
This starts with a standardized planning process. Being familiar with it helps us get to know the big picture, the overall plan. 
To make the deadlines one must learn what it takes to finish stories, epics and milestones and how best to accomplish it.

### Planning

#### User Stories
Requirements are decomposed into small feature sets and made into user stories.
A user story is short description of a small feature, in as simple and concise format as possible.
User stories are independent, autonomous features, small pieces of the whole.
User stories are prioritized, the most important ones are the next to-do items.

#### Tasks
In order to implement a user story a more technical approach is required. 
Detailed information about the technologies used, the requirements and wanted result described from a more implementation-near angle.
A user story tells what should happen, a task guides us through the how.

#### Issues
While a task helps a developer, it is often just a tiny piece, one of the many. A developer can be easily overwhelmed by the number of tasks, 
the number of things one has to deliver. To get a clear view how each task connects to the others a hierarchy os desired. 
Tasks are organized into issues containing only a handful of items. 
Reducing complexity helps maintaining clear vision and keeping track of remaining objectives.

### Pipeline
Visualization is key to have a clear view of current progress and status of issues. A kanban board is a simple and effective solution. 
This board can be on your computer or in your office as well. It contains columns as a spreadsheet does, pipes if you'd like. 
Every pipe represents a lifecycle stage of the issues. These stages mostly consist of Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Verify and Done. 
Pipes can have many names, it is not uncommon to see one or two stages come and go but this 4-5 stage is the most common. 
When an issue steps into the next stage, it is moved by the person who makes the transfer. 
It can be a physical movement on the board or a drag-and-drop effect maybe selecting an option from a dropdown. 
The board helps get a clear view of the issues, seeing in an instant what is is progress, what has to be verified and what are the top-priority todo items.

#### Backlog
This is the first location where new issues are gathered. When a new issue is created it will be seen in the most-left pipe. 
Pipes are ordered after one-another as the lifecycle of the issue changes. Like in life, from birth-to-death and in-the-middle stages - same is present at handling issues. The number of issues can easily grow over a managable and comfortable size. 
To keep track of the most important ones, the top priority issues are grouped together and moved to the Todo section.

#### Todo
The Todo pipe contains just a handful of the most important and essential issues. It serves two purposes, to provide enough task for the development team and restrict the number of choices to the minimum. The developers don't start implementing a feature right away when an issue gets in the Backlog. Either the team leader assign the issues to the other members or the individuals assigns them to themselves from the Todo list. This is the process of putting the issue into the In Progress status.

#### In progress
From this stage it is common that an issue belongs to only one person. This way it is clear who is working on what. It can be easily determined whether someone is or is not working on a task at the moment. For efficiency it is best if everyone is occupied with tasks at any time, minimizing idle time for team members. An issue is a single individual's responsibility unless the situatuion requires otherwise. When an issue's development part is finished or thought as is finished, a verification is sought from other personnel with authority.

#### Verify
For any issue claimed to be finished, the next step is to pass an acceptance test. The person accepting or rejecting the feauture is within the team. The inner verification takes place before it gets out to the users. The reviewer takes responsibility for the issue just as much as the developer who implemented the feature.


#### Done
After the issue is verified by the appointed person, it is moved to the Done stage. When these developments go live and the client gains access to the desired outcome the involved issues can then be closed removing them from the board.
